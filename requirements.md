# GramSathi AI – Requirements

## 1. Problem Statement

Rural and semi-urban populations in India face major challenges accessing healthcare information and local retail services due to:

- Low digital literacy
- Language barriers
- Limited internet connectivity
- Fragmented platforms for medical guidance and shopping

Existing platforms are urban-focused, text-heavy, and disconnected from local ecosystems.

GramSathi AI aims to bridge this gap using a voice-first AI assistant that works via WhatsApp or a lightweight mobile app.
